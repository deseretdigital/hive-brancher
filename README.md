# Hive Brancher

**hive-brancher** is a script for pulling Github repositories into staging environments so all branches
can be tested against.

- Designed to be run repeatedly to check for updates
- Will remove branches that have been deleted
- Multi-repository
- Webhook on branch post-build

## TODO

This is still a work in progress. Upcoming features may include:

- A web view so you can easily see which branches have been built
- Github notices
